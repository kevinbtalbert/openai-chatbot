modest interpretation, which is that instead evolution endowed us with neural networks precisely for that reason because this particular architecture, as opposed to the one in your laptop is very, very well adapted to solving the kind of problems that nature kept presenting our ancestors with. Right. So it makes sense that why do we have a brain in the first place? It's to be able to make predictions about the future and so on. So if we had a sucky system which could never solve, it wouldn't have so. But so this is, this is uh I think very beautiful fact. We also, we also realize that there's the there that we there's been it's been earlier work on on why deeper networks are good. But we we were able to show an additional cool factor which is uh that uh even incredibly simple problems like suppose I give you a 1000 numbers and ask you to multiply them together and you can write a few lines of code boom done trivial. If you just try to do that with a neural network that has only one single hidden layer in it,
