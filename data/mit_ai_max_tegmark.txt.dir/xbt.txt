're familiar with Steven, I know him quite well. So he is, you know, he played, you know, works with a bunch of things, but you know, cellular are these simple computable things, these computation systems. And he kind of mentioned that, you know, we probably have already within these systems already something that's a giw uh meaning like we just don't know it because we can't talk to it. So uh if, if you give me this chance to try to try to at least form a question out of this is I think it's an interesting idea to think that we can have intelligence systems, but we don't know how to describe something to them and they can't communicate with us. I know you're doing a little bit of work in explainable A I trying to get A I to explain itself. So what are your thoughts of natural language processing or some kind of other communication. How, how does the A I explain something to us? How do we explain something to it, to machines or you think of it differently? So there are two separate parts to your question ther
